  itemDescription: "Perchance this is the final token I require. What manner of deity
    did they venerate, one who granted them boundless wisdom as a boon? Doth such
    a gift infer a power akin to that of the divine? Yet, I ponder if this be truly
    their god, for its form seemeth most curious. What perplexeth me greatly is the
    ban upon summoning it. Is there some force that hindereth disaster? If this deity
    be truly divine, should it not render aid unto its people?\r"
