  itemDescription: 'In this venerable tome, it is inscribed that the music they did
    play was most beloved by their god. Each note, each melody they did weave was
    a delight unto the deity''s heart. In return, their god bestowed upon them blessings
    and an abundance of knowledge without end, hoping they would wield it wisely
    for the good of their kin in those days. Yet, the question lingers: did they
    truly use it well?'
