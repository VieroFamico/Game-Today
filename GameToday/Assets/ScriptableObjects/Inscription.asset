  itemDescription: '''Tis no wonder this place doth harbor relics of yore, such as
    this stone inscribed with ancient images. From the carvings, I may surmise that
    it doth point toward some structure or device, though its purpose remaineth obscure
    to me. But what might these symbols on the left portend? Do they signify each
    offering, or the fruits of this contrivance?'
