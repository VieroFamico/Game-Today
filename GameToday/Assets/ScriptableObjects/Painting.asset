  itemDescription: From this ancient rendering, it is shown that these folk did employ
    instruments to voice their emotions and feelings through the strains of music
    and song. They did assemble as one, blending their diverse tones. Thus, I do
    surmise, this doth mark the very genesis of my people's civilization. It is of
    no marvel, then, that within this chamber, it is decreed one must follow the
    melody's course.
